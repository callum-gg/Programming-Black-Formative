            A good freely available education is taken for granted in many countries. There are countries around the world such as Niger where only 17% of girls aged 15-24 are literate or Liberia where 2/3 of primary school children drop of out school. The Internet allows anyone to get access to any information they wish to find. There are websites such as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target = "_blank">Wikipedia</a> which is a very reliable free source of information which allow anyone to learn easily.

            The Internet also creates opportunites to gain a full education without having to physically go to school for example the <a href =  "https://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University.</a> There are thousands of paid courses which allow anyone at any age to get qualifications.
