    <h1>Predicting and Preventing Natural Disasters</h1>
    <p>
        Computers have been predicting the weather with some level of success since the 1950s - This is known as numerical weather prediction.
        Since then, numerical weather prediction continues to become more accurate as we use more advanced technology.
        Knowing when and where a natural disaster will hit has helped mitigate many hurricanes such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Hurricane Rita (2005)</li>
            <li>Hurricane Gustav (2008)</li>
            <li>Hurricane Ike (2008)</li>
            <li>Hurricane Harvey (2017)</li>
        </ul>
        Amoung 
        <a href = "https://disasterphilanthropy.org/disaster/2021-atlantic-hurricane-season/">many others</a>. 
        By predicting the nature of these hurricanes before they hit, appropriate measures can be taken to prevent potential catastrophies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Creating predictions with even just a minor amount of success requires a lot of computational power. Since there are so many constantly changing factors to take into account when predicting the weather, supercomputers have been necessary for creating the most accurate predictions.
        Increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a mojor role in monitoring the weather. Since we now have so much data on different natural disasters, it is an ideal problem for AI to solve.
